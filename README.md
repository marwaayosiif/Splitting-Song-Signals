# Comments on the problem

## - Ecg file 

Using the ica Library

When we press on ecg split the file i download will be drawn on the first Plotwidget 

Since the arrhythmia is so small compare to the original ecg so the original signal and the singal ecg that generated from teh spliting are similar

Using the ica Library

When we press on CocktailParty split the file i download will be drawn on the first PlotWidget
